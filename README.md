# SO2_Exposure

The Main_Calculate_Exposure.py code calculates the amount concentration and dose of SO2 along a flight trajectory and and saves this information in a csv file. It also plots the cumulative SO2 dose.
The Exposure_Plotting.py code uses the csv file created in the Main_Calculate_Exposure.py code to plot the data on a map.
